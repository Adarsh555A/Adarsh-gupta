                <p class="center">Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. Wikipedia
                    Developer: Python Software Foundation
                    First appeared: 20 February 1991; 31 years ago

                    Typing discipline: Duck, dynamic, strong typing; gradual (since 3.5, but ignored in CPython)

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Html css javascript</h2>
                <p class="center">HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript are the languages that run the web. They’re very closely related, but they’re also designed for very specific tasks. Understanding how they interact will go a long way towards becoming a web developer. We’ll be expanding on this throughout the tutorial, but the gist of it is:
                    HTML is for adding meaning to raw content by marking it up.
                    CSS is for formatting that marked up content.
                    JavaScript is for making that content and formatting interactive.
                    Think of HTML as the abstract text and images behind a web page, CSS as the page that actually gets displayed, and JavaScript as the behaviors that can manipulate both HTML and CSS..</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Digital marketing</h2>
                <p class="center">Digital marketing is the component of marketing that uses the Internet and online based digital technologies such as desktop computers, mobile phones and other digital media and platforms to promote products and services. Its development during the 1990s and 2000s changed the way brands and businesses use technology for marketing. As digital platforms became increasingly incorporated into marketing plans and everyday life, and as people increasingly use digital devices instead of visiting physical shops,[5][6] digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent, employing combinations of search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), content marketing, influencer marketing, content automation, campaign marketing, data-driven marketing, e-commerce marketing, social media marketing, social media optimization, e-mail direct marketing, display advertising, e–books, and optical disks and games have become commonplace. Digital marketing extends to non-Internet channels that provide digital media, such as television, mobile phones (SMS and MMS), callback, and on-hold mobile ring tones.The extension to non-Internet channels differentiates digital marketing from online advertising.</p>
